      <p>Our office will send the requesting party an explanation of the services to be provided, an email with forms to be completed prior ot the initial appointment an payment instructions.</p>
      <p>Patient's Responsibility seeking Insurance Reimbursement:&nbsp; Due to the variable nature of insurance reimbursement and authorization, patients are responsible for contacting their insurance carrier for coverage and payment. Our services are generally approved by insurance carriers for medical necessity. As a courtesy, we will file claims on behalf of the patient, however, the patient is repsonbile for payment of all charges for services rendered. If you have any questions regarding the necessary forms or payment policy, please feel free to contact our office at 949.478.4503 or email office@npsyp.com </p>
      <p>Insurance Carrier Disclaimer: “A coverage determination, prior authorization, or certification that is made prior to a service being performed is not a promise to pay for the service at any particular rate or amount. The patient’s summary plan description governs amount payable, as every claim submitted is subject to all plan provisions, including, but not limited to, eligibility requirements, exclusions, limitations, and applicable state mandates.” </p>
      <p>We have found that the best way for a subscriber to receive the maximum reimbursement, is for the subscriber to confirm their insurance coverage for medical care and their financial responsibilty for their particular plan. We encourage the patient/subscriber to call their insurer to confirm coverages and reinbursements (use the 800 number on the back of card) for Psychological and/or Neuropsychological Services, CPT Codes:
